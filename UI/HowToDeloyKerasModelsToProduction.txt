How To Deploy Keras Models to Production:

1. Train model with Keras [x]
2. Save our model
3. Write out Flask backend to serve our saved model (dep calsses- load.py)
4. Deploy our code to Google Cloud

Flask - backend code in Python (simplest way)
Install: pip install flask 

Save two files
- json file (the architevture)
- weights (parameters of the trained model)
	- load both later with flask 

Flask dependencies
- render_template - lets us define a stand alone HTML and call it 
- request - handle GET, SET, POST
- scipy.misc import imsave, imread, imresize - format input image
	
- numpy (?)
- keras.model - to upload our model
- re - used ot handle huge string data
- sys - system level operations (ex. load file)
- os - operating system data

Global variables
- model - encapsulate model
- graph - similar to session info


Files:
train.py - train model
load.py - formats model and graph 
app.py - with flask web app 
index.html - format with ajaxindex.js - track mouse movements (dont need)

Impload to Cloud
- gcloud app deploy
- gcloud app browse
- need to download sdk (before you begin)
